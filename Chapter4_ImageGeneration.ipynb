    "## Overview of Diffusion Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffusion models are a class of generative models that iteratively refine random noise into coherent data (e.g., images). These models are widely used for high-quality image generation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps in Diffusion-Based Image Generation:\n",
    "1. **Forward Process**: Adds noise to data progressively.\n",
    "2. **Reverse Process**: Removes noise step by step, reconstructing the original data.\n",
    "3. **Inference**: Generates new data by reversing the noise addition process.\n",
