    "# Chapter 7: Deploying Gen AI Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploying Generative AI models enables their integration into real-world applications such as chatbots, recommendation systems, and more. This chapter covers the deployment process on cloud platforms and optimizing inference for efficient performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deploying on Cloud Platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular cloud platforms for model deployment include:\n",
    "- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: Services like SageMaker for model deployment.\n",
    "- **GCP (Google Cloud Platform)**: AI Platform for model training and deployment.\n",
    "- **Azure**: Azure ML for hosting and managing models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Deploying on AWS\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Step 1: Upload your model to an S3 bucket.\n",
    "aws s3 cp model_directory s3://your-bucket-name --recursive\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2: Create a SageMaker endpoint.\n",
    "aws sagemaker create-endpoint     --endpoint-name your-endpoint-name     --model-name your-model-name\n",

    "## Optimizing Model Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizing Generative AI models involves reducing latency and computational cost without compromising accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Techniques:\n",
    "1. **Quantization**: Reduces the precision of weights (e.g., from FP32 to INT8).\n",
    "2. **Model Pruning**: Removes less significant parts of the model to reduce size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Detecting GPU Usage for Optimization\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import torch\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check GPU availability\n",
    "if torch.cuda.is_available():\n",
    "    print(f\"Running on GPU: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Running on CPU\")\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Code Example: Deploying a Hugging Face Model with FastAPI\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI\n",
    "from transformers import pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "app = FastAPI()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load a text generation pipeline\n",
    "generator = pipeline(\"text-generation\", model=\"gpt2\")\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.post(\"/generate/\")\n",
    "async def generate(prompt: str, max_length: int = 50):\n",
    "    response = generator(prompt, max_length=max_length)\n",
    "    return {\"generated_text\": response[0][\"generated_text\"]}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run the API server\n",
    "# Command: uvicorn script_name:app --reload\n",

    "## Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the primary purpose of quantization in model optimization?\n",
    "   - A. To improve accuracy.\n",
    "   - B. To reduce computational costs.\n",
    "   - C. To increase the size of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Which command is used to upload a model to an AWS S3 bucket?\n",
    "   - A. aws cp model s3://bucket-name\n",
    "   - B. aws s3 cp model_directory s3://bucket-name --recursive\n",
    "   - C. aws upload model_directory bucket-name\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answers:\n",
    "1. **B**: To reduce computational costs.\n",
    "2. **B**: aws s3 cp model_directory s3://bucket-name --recursive\n",

    "## Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task:\n",
    "1. Deploy a basic text-generation service using FastAPI and Hugging Face.\n",
    "2. Optimize the model for inference by enabling GPU usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Solution:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from transformers import pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check for GPU and use it if available\n",
    "device = 0 if torch.cuda.is_available() else -1\n",
    "generator = pipeline(\"text-generation\", model=\"gpt2\", device=device)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use the generator in your FastAPI app as shown in the example above.\n",
